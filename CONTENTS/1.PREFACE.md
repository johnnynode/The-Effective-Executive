PREFACE

>　Management books usually deal with managing other people. The subject of this book is managing oneself for effectiveness. That one can truly manage other people is by no means adequately proven. But one can always manage oneself. Indeed, executives who do not manage themselves for effectiveness cannot possibly expect to manage their associates and subordinates. Management is largely by example. Executives who do not know how to make themselves effective in their own job and work set the wrong example.

>　To be reasonably effective it is not enough for the individual to be intelligent, to work hard or to be knowledgeable. Effectiveness is something separate, somthing different. But to be effective also does not require special gifts, special aptitude, or special training. Effectiveness as an executive demands doing certain - and fairly simple - things. It consists of a small number of practices, the parctices that are presented and discussed in this book. But thesse practices are not "inborn." in forty-five years of work as a consultant with a large numbe of executives in a wide variety of organizations - large and small; businesses, government agencies, labor unions, hospitals, universities, community services; American, European, Latin American and Japanese - I have not come across a sigle "natural": an executive who was born effective. All the effective ones have had to learn to be effective. And all of them then had to practice effectiveness until it became habit. But all the ones who worked on making themselves effectives executives succeedd in doing so. Effectiveness can be learned - and it also has to be learned.
